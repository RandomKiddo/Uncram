### About

Uncram is a repository that attempts to implement multiple decompression algorithms. 
Algorithms implemented can be simple (like run-length) or complicated (like huffman).

___

### Algorithms

This repository implements the following lossless algorithms: [Run Length](#run-length), [LZW](#lzw), and [Huffman](#huffman)

##### Run Length

Run Length encoding uses the following system, and is a very simple text file compression method.

Simplify a line like `a4b2c1d4e2` to `aaaabbcddddee`

##### LZW

##### Huffman

___

### Sister Repository

This repository has a sister repository called Cram that seeks to compress the files decompressed using these algorithms.

### How to Run

Just simply download the [`uncram_latest.zip`](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/cram/blob/master/uncram_latest.zip) file in the repository and extract the contents.
Then just run whichever file you want to test out. 

:exclamation: `G++` compiler recommended. This repository has not been tested for `Clang`, `GCC`, `EDG`, and other compilers. `GCC` is the most likely alternative to work, since it is closely related to `G++`
